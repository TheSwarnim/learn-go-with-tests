The following sequence of steps is generally followed:

Add a test – Write a test case that describe the function completely. In order to make the test cases the developer must understand the features and requirements using user stories and use cases.
Run all the test cases and make sure that the new test case fails.
Write the code that passes the test case
Run the test cases
Refactor code – This is done to remove duplication of code.
Repeat the above mentioned steps again and again
